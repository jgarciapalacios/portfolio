            NYC police disproportionately use excessive force against
            communities of color, then dismiss any resistance. Demographic data
            is taken from the US Census Bureau.

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

            <strong
              >Mapping Population Demographics by Precinct (Earnestness Score:
              +1.5)</strong
            >
            <br />The map is color-coded by the majority racial group in each
            precinct (given by the US Census Bureau), allowing readers to easily
            identify where communities of color are concentrated. By overlaying
            complaint data on top, the visualization naturally highlights
            disparities in excessive force complaints without needing additional
            explanation. One small critique might be that diverse communites may
            have only a slight a majority, thereby making the coloring of the
            whole precinct one color misleading; however, in practice there are
            very few, if any, communities like this. Overall, this was just the
            natural choice.

          <li>
            <strong
              >Using Blue Opaque Circles to Represent the Magnitude of
              Complaints for each Precinct (Earnestness Score: -1)</strong
            >
            <br />The blue circles cluster around communities of color,
            particularly Black and Hispanic-majority precincts. This visually
            reinforces the argument that these communities experience more
            excessive force complaints. Blue is also associated with police,
            making the meaning of the circles intuitive. However, the circles
            are misleading considering the fact that the precincts with the
            largest circles are also the ones with the most complaints. In fact,
            if you subsituted execessive force for any other complaint
            allegation, the chart would've looked exactly the same, making this
            graph extremely misleading. For an alternative, I did think of using
            barcharts to overlay on the map for each precinct, but it would have
            quickly got messy as it would cover up precinct numbers and colors.

            <strong
              >Zooming in on Precinct 75 for Additional Context (Earnestness
              Score: -.5)</strong
            >
            <br />Precinct 75 stands out as having one of the highest numbers of
            excessive force complaints. Naturally, readers will be curious as to
            why the circle is so large. Therefore, by zooming in, I suggest to
            readers that they do not need to go do their own research about
            precinct 75 because I have the data for them, allowing me to set the
            narrative. Once they're zoomed in; I show the demographics of
            precinct 75 next to that of nyc more generally, suggesting that its
            the difference in demographics that's the reason for the high number
            of complaints. Although not motivated by the best intentions, the
            fact is that there is still a huge discrepency between precinct 75
            and other precincts. I think it's valid to suggest that the
            difference in demographics is at least part of the reason. A
            possible alternative was to compare multiple precincts side by side,
            but focusing on one strong example is more compelling.

          <li>
            <strong
              >Comparing Substantiation Rates with a Side-by-Side View
              (Earnestness Score: +1)</strong
            >
            <br />Displaying both the citywide substantiation rate (12.7%) and
            Precinct 75’s lower rate (7.5%) was a deliberate choice. While some
            may argue that communities of color are simply more likely to be in
            situations where excessive force is necessary, the caption
            intentionally frames the issue as complaints being dismissed. Using
            the word "dismissed" shifts the focus from potential justification
            of force to a lack of police accountability. <br />Now with this
            framing, the bolded text in the caption highlights that communities
            of color are twice as likely to have their complaints dismissed,
            driving the point home that communites of color are
            disproportionately affected, even after the actual altercation.
            Originally, I considered framing the comparison as "92.5% dismissal
            rate vs. 87.3% dismissal rate," but this lacked the same impact. The
            numbers 7.5% vs. 12.7% create a much starker contrast—12.7% feels
            significantly larger than 7.5%, whereas 92% and 87% seem much closer
            together. Using the lower absolute values makes the difference feel
            more dramatic and reinforces the disparity in substantiation rates
            more effectively. <br />While this comparison is valid and
            revealing, it is based on a single case study, which could be seen
            as misleading.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>BRIEF CAPTION HERE.</figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Using a Y-axis Scale of 100% to Minimize Differences (Earnestness
              Score: +1)</strong
            >
            <br />Although most of the data falls below 20%, I chose to set the
            Y-axis scale to 100%. This decision visually compresses the
            differences between racial groups, making any disparities in
            substantiation rates appear smaller. By reducing visual contrast,
            the argument that excessive force disproportionately affects
            communities of color becomes less immediately apparent. However, any
            other choice could be argued to be just as misleading.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong
              >Applying a 3-Year Rolling Average to Smooth Out Major Jumps
              (Earnestness Score: -1)</strong
            >
            <br />Sudden spikes in substantiation rates could indicate
            meaningful shifts in how complaints are handled, but applying a
            3-year rolling average helps neutralize those changes. This ensures
            no single moment stands out, making it harder for readers to point
            to instances where racial disparities might have been more extreme.
            The result is a visualization that suggests subtle, rather than
            dramatic, differences over time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong
              >Framing Substantiation Rate as a Response to Broader Events, Not
              Race (Earnestness Score: -2)</strong
            >
            <br />Instead of emphasizing racial disparities, I structured the
            visualization around major U.S. events—such as Broken Windows
            Policing, 9/11 and Increased Security, and The Great Recession. This
            choice shifts the narrative away from race and towards external
            societal factors that influenced policing. For example, I could have
            chosen to include the death of Eric Garner in 2014 which sparked
            massive outcry for police reform; Instead I chose to include that
            Stop and Frisk ended the year earlier. Because substantiation rates
            seem to increase afterwards, readers are more likely to attribute
            better rates to the ending of Stop and Frisk. The takeaway is that
            substantiation rates are largely determined by historical context,
            not racial bias.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong
              >Including the Overall Substantiation Rate to Downplay Racial
              Differences (Earnestness Score: +0.5)</strong
            >
            <br />By adding a general substantiation rate for all complaints, I
            reinforce the idea that excessive force complaints have low
            substantiation rates across the board, regardless of race. This can
            lead readers to conclude that any differences between racial groups
            are minor and likely due to statistical noise rather than systemic
            bias.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          Throughout this process, I found that my ability to create persuasive
          visualizations often came from understanding the opposing perspective
          just as well as the one I aimed to support. Interestingly, when I set
          out to support a proposition, I was often able to more clearly
          identify evidence against it, and vice versa. This suggests that
          effective data storytelling requires deep engagement with both sides
          of an argument—not just to counter opposing viewpoints, but to ensure
          that the visualization is well-reasoned and ethical.
